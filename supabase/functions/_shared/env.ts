// Server-side configuration.
//
// Same discipline as the three placeholder constants in `src/lib/spl.ts`, and
// deliberately the same three values: the $xNFT mint, the treasury wallet and the
// dev wallet. An address that does not exist yet is empty, and every path that
// would need it returns `not-configured` instead of guessing. $xNFT is not
// deployed at the time of writing, so the honest default is "unset" and the
// honest response to a call is a 503 that says so.
//
// Nothing here has a fallback value for a real address. There is no program id
// any more — the old `XNFT_PROGRAM_ID` gate is gone with the program — and what
// replaced it is a stricter thing rather than a looser one: ingestion no longer
// asks "did our program run?", it asks "did exactly these tokens move between
// exactly these accounts?", which nothing but the real transfer can satisfy.
//
// ONE GATE, THREE ADDRESSES, matching isConfigured() in src/lib/spl.ts. Every
// path here touches at least two of them — recognising a mint needs the mint and
// the treasury, settling a payout needs the treasury and the dev wallet — so a
// half-configured backend could only ever produce a reading nobody chose.
