// Deployment configuration, resolved at RUNTIME from Supabase rather than baked
// into the bundle at build time.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The mint address, the wallet that receives payments, and the
// market links were VITE_ variables. Vite substitutes those during the build, so
// changing one meant a rebuild and a redeploy — and the mint address is the value
// most likely to need changing in a hurry, because it is the one that decides
// which token a visitor's wallet is asked to send. Config that takes a deploy to
// fix is config you cannot fix during an incident.
//
// They now live in one Supabase row. An operator edits it and every open browser
// picks it up on the next poll, with no deploy and no downtime.
//
// WHAT STAYED BUILD-TIME. The Supabase URL and anon key. They are what a browser
// needs to reach this table at all, so putting them in the table would be a
// circular dependency.
//
// THE SAFETY RULE IS UNCHANGED. Unset still means refuse. A config that has not
// loaded, failed to load, or carries an empty mint produces exactly the same
// answer as the old empty constant did: every real-value path declines and builds
// nothing. Making config dynamic must not make it optional.
