// The fee engine for the SIMULATED marketplace, and the raw-unit conversions the
// whole app shares. Every charge this codebase computes is computed here and
// nowhere else, so a quote shown in the UI and the amount a ledger row records
// can never disagree about a rounding unit.
//
// NOTHING HERE PRICES A MINT. That absence is the point and it is recent: a mint
// used to be 10,000 $xNFT burned plus a 5% leg to the treasury, and it is now
// 10,000 burned and nothing else — one `transferChecked`, one destination, no
// fee, no second amount to reconcile. The rates below survive only because sales
// and contracts are still priced, and both of those are Postgres rows rather than
// transfers.
//
// They are named SIM_* for that reason. A reader reaching for "the protocol fee"
// must not be able to pick one up and thread it back through the mint path by
// accident, and a fee constant that merely *reads* as protocol-wide is exactly
// how that happens. There is no zero-valued mint fee parameter anywhere in this
// codebase either, because a dormant fee is a fee someone re-enables.
//
// One exception, stated out loud rather than left to be discovered: `spl.ts`
// still carries a `buildRentTransaction` that composes SIM_RENT_FEE_BPS into a
// real SPL transfer. Nothing in the app calls it — rentals are Supabase rows. If
// it is ever wired to a button, that rate stops being simulated and both this
// comment and the constant's name have to change with it.
//
// SOLE IMPLEMENTATION — there is no on-chain program and no Rust counterpart to
// keep in step. `spl.ts` composes plain SPL Token transfers whose amounts come
// from this file, so the quote on screen and the amount in the wallet prompt are
// the same bigint rather than two spellings that have to agree. This used to be
// one half of a matched pair with `fee_of()` in an Anchor program; that program
// was abandoned (see `anchor/ABANDONED.md`) and nothing replaced it.
//
// Money is bigint raw units throughout. Floats appear at precisely two places,
// both marked: toRawUnits() on the way in, fromRawUnits() on the way out. The
// simulated market quotes listing prices as ordinary numbers, so the conversion
// has to live somewhere — it lives here, once, rather than in every caller.
