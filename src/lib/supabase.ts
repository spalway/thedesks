// Read-only Supabase client, anon key only.
//
// Supabase is an index and a payout queue, never an authority on a balance. If it
// disagrees with the chain, the chain is right and this index gets rebuilt — so
// nothing in the app should ever gate a decision on a number that came from here.
//
// Four rules shape this module, and they are the same ones that hold spl.ts
// together:
//
//   1. There is no write. Not a disabled one, not a guarded one — this file has
//      no insert, update or delete, and no generic query builder that could grow
//      one. The two POST helpers at the bottom call Edge Functions, which do
//      their own verification against the chain. RLS denies client writes at the
//      database too; this is the second lock, not the only one.
//   2. Configuration is a gate. VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are
//      empty until a project exists, and every call returns `not-configured`
//      while they are, the way isConfigured() gates every transfer path.
//   3. Money crosses the wire as a decimal string and is reconstructed with
//      BigInt. Amount columns are `text` in Postgres precisely so that PostgREST
//      cannot hand the browser a JSON number that has already been through a
//      double. A malformed amount is an error, never a silent zero.
//   4. Nothing throws. Every failure RESOLVES to a SupabaseError the UI renders,
//      which is the same contract spl.ts is written under.
//   5. THE SCHEMA IS THE CONTRACT, AND ONE BAD ROW IS ONE BAD ROW. A column the
//      database is allowed to leave null is modelled null here, and a row this
//      module cannot read is dropped by itself instead of taking its siblings
//      with it. Both halves were once wrong in the same direction and the result
//      was not a subtle inaccuracy — it was three reads returning `malformed`
//      permanently, from the very first row, because the parsers demanded columns
//      the schema deliberately leaves empty:
//
//        payouts.amount is NULL until confirm-payout reads the settled transfer
//        off the chain (that nullness IS the "never treat a client-asserted
//        amount as truth" rule), mints.xployee_id is null on every genuine mint
//        because two token transfers carry no room to name an xployee, and
//        trades.signature/slot are FORCED null on every simulated sale by
//        trades_origin_matches_evidence. Each of those made an entire page
//        unrenderable.
//
//      So: required means "not null in the schema AND the row is unusable
//      without it" — an identity and its money. Everything the schema permits to
//      be null is `| null` below, and every read returns a RowSet carrying how
//      many rows were dropped, so a caller summing money can tell a complete page
//      from a partial one instead of being handed a quietly short total.
//
// Rule 4 has a corollary that cost this app a crashing page once, so it is
// written down rather than left to be rediscovered: because a failure resolves,
// `await`ing one of these functions and using the result without a type guard
// hands the *error object* to code expecting rows. NONE of these functions may be
// passed straight to a framework that treats a resolved value as success —
// TanStack Query's `queryFn` in particular. Callers unwrap at their own boundary
// and convert a SupabaseError into whatever failure their framework understands.
// See `orThrow` in usePayouts.ts for the one place this app does that.
//
// The anon key is public by design — it is compiled into the bundle and visible
// to anyone. It is safe there only because the policies in
// supabase/migrations/20260805120200_rls_policies.sql grant it SELECT and nothing
// else, on tables that hold nothing private.

//      `auth_user_id` and `twitter_user_id`, and `select=*` expands to every

//      permission error on the whole read rather than a narrower row. Naming
//      columns is also what stops a future migration adding a column and silently
//      widening what this browser downloads.
//   2. Nullability is copied from the DDL, not from what a happy row happens to
//      contain. The rule at the top of this file was learned from three reads that
//      returned `malformed` forever; these tables have far more nullable columns
//      than the originals — `responded_at`, `read_at`, `expires_at`, `paid_at`,
//      every operator field — and modelling any of them as required would repeat
//      it exactly.
